1.SWISH TECHNIQUE

Whenever U Get Compulsions For The Habit
See Yourself As A Different Person That You Want To Become and clearly see the visionary person u have become (eg. When u want to watch porn and masturbate - see urself as a person how u would be when u r full of energy / how u will achieve all ur goals)

2. Use states of sound/smell to induce certain states of memories within someone or within u so that u will be in a different state,

3. When u want to find a solution to a problem, try looking in a direction different than what u normally look in when thinking of how to solve this problem
Eg if u look right then look left",UgxHnYefnNtPnacWoCN4AaABAg,2,17,2019-05-22T15:00:07Z,2020-12-17T12:22:33Z

I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  

It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” 

The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.

HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?

I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0

BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!

It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

To understand NLP and use it effectively you need to understand the programming that creates beliefs and how to navigate it and rewire it. Simply telling someone to change their belief or create a better belief doesn't usually work and that's why we learn and practice NLP, to understand how it works so we can change it.",Ugxs7_8pRpZaphHAtGR4AaABAg,13,46,2016-06-17T15:49:14Z,2019-06-20T15:31:29Z

This talk only represents the speaker's personal views and understanding of ...,syvKeNKww_Y,"I see comments that are positive and negative about NLP. Just want to add a perspective to those who will be reading this after it is posted. 

90% of what affects you is what you believe or in other words what you market to yourself. There are comments about NLP being a marketing technique or a pseudoscience. Marketing is only making information available, whether or not the information is going to affect you in anyway to take an action depends on you. Also, science deals with objective world and mind is not an objective thing. It a very personal, subjective thing. That is why we have so many different types of people with varied experiences in life.
When it comes to dealing with the 'mind', the use of objective or scientific analysis as a tool is going to fail at some point. It is equivalent to talking about using an external tool to measure someone's spiritual progress. The true progress is known only to the soul. Similarly when it comes to mind, the progress is determined by the individual's mind and the stuff (experience, emotions, and programming) it has. Since every person is unique in that aspect, it is not easy to quantify these things using a controlled experiment/study. The only true assessment is to try it genuinely and see if it works. You never know what is going to help you if you are hasty in making a judgement and coming to a conclusion. Many entrepreneurs and corporate leaders use this approach. It is all about self-management. Give yourself a chance.",UgxWhzIonHlLuLpAhPh4AaABAg,2,8,2016-06-17T15:49:14Z,2018-09-18T11:08:36Z

Keep up the good work, and thank you so much!",UgyEGoB-tLjasxNbRZx4AaABAg,0,7,2017-06-22T16:01:37Z,2019-03-31T15:52:14Z

I am very glad I came across this video. I think anyone truly interested in learning and particularly in learning about the workings of the mind would find a lot of value in this video. I loved how the speaker talks and teaches, for me it was very easy to take in and understand. I think most of the backlash in the comments comes from the ""click-bate"" title. Clearly this video is an hour and a half long, which to me is a plus. But no this is not a ten minute video that will suddenly make you become who you want to be, and I think the people who are looking for some quick trick may be missing the big picture in all this anyway. If you really care to change I think you have to gain an understanding of how things work and how your own mind works which to me cannot be taught/understood in ten minutes.

Nearly a decade ago, after getting hit by a car which resulted in epilepsy, several TBIs, and severe cognitive issues / deficiencies.  To most others, at this point, I seem fully functional, but it takes a great deal of effort at times.  Listening to you and your peers discuss the brain [which is now a fascination of mine more than ever, ha!] gives me a framework that I can work with.  For me losing my cognitive abilities as an adult and then learning to rebuild them was exactly like learning my first ""second language"" when I was in junior high.  It is both comforting and inspiring to hear and read about processes that offer solutions to complex situations,  Presented as such, it is much more clear how to re-develop or start new patterns and positive feedback loops. My neuro teams have been mostly good at providing anti-seizure medication, but not much else except to admit that the brain remains a mystery.  It's good when people are honest, especially one's med teams, but a toolkit is even better.  Thank you, again. for this!",Ugz7OvmnnR9nbBDo5h54AaABAg,0,3,2016-09-26T13:40:54Z,2019-01-03T12:54:43Z

It was interesting to notice how Jane was described at 01:03:22, this is where I can fully relate to. 

Is there any further source of information available regarding this specific behaviour, so that you really try hard and perform best initially but then become the guaranteed dropout as described with the abovementioned example with Jane.

This is the first time i learned that this behavioural trait can was described and can be tackled, and as i am struggling with this ever since I would be more than grateful to learn where I can find more information or resources.

“They told me I couldn’t run because of my feet...now I’ve ran many marathons”. 

“There was a rope swing and I had to swing on it. I did, one armed like Tarzan pounding my chest, and I broke my arm in two places”.

“I was on a church ski outing and I was in the hospital again”.

“When my wife, Stephanie, became pregnant with my first son Dashel...”.

Why so many lies, with the claims that, “you can write you’re own story”?
Why so many lies, when “NLP isn’t good or evil, it doesn’t have a conscious”?
It takes a conscious effort to lie. 

Something isn’t adding up.

Actors performing don't necessarily need to be the character in real life.. they just have to be able to ACT like they are and be convincing,  This speaker was convincing with his story about the skii trip... because someone else had the same exact line in another video.  This is their script as it seems.. good thing to know.  Because what you are watching is really about changing your awareness not necessary judging if the speaker is being who they are in the video.. he could just assume any identity in the seminar.. but that's not the point.. the point is teaching... and what the audience in this video is learning... interesting",UgiLeOBbthLcvngCoAEC,7,11,2016-09-26T13:40:54Z,2017-06-28T18:43:56Z

If you don't handle this right away, you get sucked into defending a position which just ends up burning valuable time. 

I'd also assume she is used to being right, and understanding lots of stuff as long as the information is in alignment with her internal map of the world.

Tools on YouTube can be seen and used or misused by all kind of people, in the strangest political regimes, somewhere on earth. It definitely does not strengthen NLP. When NLP struggles from time to time, being called not serious by the professional community, it is because far to many tools are out on Internet, and people without any knowledge about the ethical and ecological foundations and the presuppositions in NLP can use it, without any possibility to get qualified feedback or help when things going wrong. We should definitely train it in groups of 3 and have a assistant or Trainer nearby as backup. 

Why does dentists newer show their procedures and technics on YouTube, so everybody can play dentist? Or surgeons newer showing, how to do a complicated transplantation on YouTube? Why does a surgeon or a dentist just help people, without showing every step on YouTube? 
Converting theoretical knowledge from own education, into practical helping people, must be the goal.
Why is NLP the only field, where people showing their huge parts of education on YouTube, things you did not invent, but just use others work and give it away on Internet, perhaps boosting the Ego. Tools we did learn in our Practitioner and Master education - in a save environment, are definitely not some give away like food recipes or repairing a car. 
Visual Squash and parts of Core transformation in a NLP Introduction? This does violent everything we did learn from the Founders of the most  tools in NLP in Santa Cruz and Boulder Colorado.

In German we also have ""unconscious"" which means ""unbewusst"" - like doing something unconsciously, but there is no real German word for the term ""unconscious mind"" (unbewusstsein), we just use a similar term for ""not knowing, that.. "" as ""unbewusst sein, nicht bewusst sein, dass..."". And ""subconscious"" which means ""unterbewusst"", but we almost exclusively use that word in combination with the mind, ""das Unterbewusstsein"".so you can say we are saying ""unconsciously (doing stuff)"", or ""the subconscious mind"". Some people use the term ""subconsciously"" but I don't know if that term is legit, to me personally it feels grammatically wrong.

NLP,Mike Sweet,How To Use An NLP Anchor?,Anchoring can allow you to create a beneficial or prime state very quickly. Creating anchors are like creating bookmarks in your mind. you can allow you to ...,PVCp3Fizy94,"Hey Mr. Sweet!

So I just started listening to Tony Robbins' Unlimited Power, and as you may know, at the time he authored this he was using NLP and sharing some of the basics.  Among other things he talked about anchoring and triggers. I got enough from it to understand how to create an anchor. But what I want to know is how to I remove or disable (or whatever the word might be) an unwanted trigger?

In one of his examples, Mr. Robbins talks about how he went to stay st some hotel, and had issues with his luggage. Turned out it had been stolen, He was very angry as a result, in an intense state, and as his wife was there, even though he let it go, by imagining the thief trying on his clothes, when he saw his wife's face later it triggered that anger which he had been feeling back at the hotel. Apparently this is a common issue with many relationships.

I would like to know how I can become aware of unwanted triggers like that, and how I can break those triggers, so they no longer trigger those emotions, which aren't even relevant to whatever I am experiencing in the present moment. They are things I felt in the past, being triggered presently. That is what I would like to become aware of and then neutralize. I have already learned a lot about old stories, becoming aware of these, supplanting them with a new story that is more positive and supportive. It seems to me that becoming aware of old triggers and supplanting those is the next logical step.

If you could direct me to any books, resources of videos that teach this subject directly and specifically, I would really appreciate it. Thank you! Also, what is the official name for the process of removing anchors or triggers?",Ugwv0sGt5d9lNzWhoV14AaABAg,0,1,2017-10-10T11:43:11Z,2021-02-08T01:38:18Z

Maybe a way must be found to translate the world just as humans do, namely through pictures.
Pictures are like paragraphs of sentences, but zipped.
Image pattern recognition is already a thing, if only a small thing.
If now a sentence can be translated into an image, then the patterns can be stored more efficient than words.
Take ""A man riding a horse through the woods"".
I imagine a man my age, then a horse, the man on the horse, then woods and finally a direction which alters the legs of the horse.
I imagine laying these pictures on top of each other. And it doesn't even matter if my image of woods differ from any body else.
Every picture element can very much be translated into a vector. And these vectors can be set into a distance calculation to lets say rain forest, dark, light or any other kind of forest.

There would not need to be a vector for the meaning of a sentence. The vectors for the elements would suffice.

There is a flip side to all this though.
It opens up the the guarantee that AI could very much be equally as filtered, plastic, biased and faulty as the human mind.
Also AI then might just be equally as creative like the human mind.
At least the AI attention span would exceed humans by worlds.",UgwT4KNHfU2LRkhsbsZ4AaABAg,1,0,2019-09-27T20:59:11Z,2019-09-27T23:10:05Z

The interview was done by Michel Wozniak and Nathalie ...,jZrX6NjQDd8,"When you purchase a car, 5 years later it develops 5 years worth of wear and tear.  Eventually, parts break down.   Your body on the other hand is different.  Old cells are constantly broken down and replaced by new cells in every organ.  But when people say ""I'm 45,  i'm 47, oh i'm so old, etc.."", the subconscious goes ""ok.  as you say.""  and then shuts down certain processes that lead to the creation of new heart cells, muscle cells, cells of other organs and so on.  On the other hand if you are constantly young at heart, go to the gym, and constantly put in an age like 20 or 27 in the exercise machines, guess what happens?
You can actually ask your subconscious to repair your body.  To make it like it was when you were in your 20's.  As an experiment just try it.  You can also ask it to identify and remove any negative past programming and ask it to make you aware of any negative programming that may go into you in the future.  
Have a nasty habit or addiction?  Don't use willpower to fight it.  Your subconscious doesn't have any addictions, it doesn't need food, or sugar or any of that junk.  Ask it so please promise you to release you from all your addictions,  to drive you to be more disciplined, and to teach you Exactly how to exercise to get extremely fit.  And then go from there.",Ugxo31fuzKnmigY1RKd4AaABAg,1,12,2020-06-12T14:50:29Z,2020-08-05T08:32:28Z

I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  

It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” 

The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.

HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?

I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0

BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!

It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   

Thanks and God bless!

Having studied Method acting extensively I can attest to the use of modalities and sub-modalities along with many other techniques that some of the greatest actors in the world use on stage and in films. Have you ever wondered why or how actors can draw you into the situation (as if) they are in by conveying their feelings and you are then emotionally drawn in to what you are watching? I will admit that you must possess empathy to be emotionally committed as narcissists fall out of such capability. The action of NLP truly works but, only if you are someone who is highly conscientious of human interaction with the capability to read the subtle facial or physical tells and changes that most people are unaware of conveying.",UgyNyXEv1Hc6v6J9Gap4AaABAg,1,0,2016-10-29T02:32:45Z,2018-11-05T03:17:42Z

NLP,Damon Cart,3 NLP Techniques You Must Know,LEARN THESE POWERFUL NLP TECHNIQUES! Neuro Linguistic Programming created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder took self improvement into the ...,DhB9fE-TQow,"Would you consider this a type of NLP technique at all?: 

I created this mental box analogy just over a year ago to help myself battle social anxiety disorder, where I would picture myself (my life/my self worth) as or in a box. I would then picture other people (each an individual box) & their opinions, judgments, criticism, etc., in their box. I did this to compartmentalize & separate their thoughts (real or perceived) from mine. (This was a real sanity saver for me!) So, basically every time the anxiety would set in, I would do this mental exercise where I imagined their opinions in their box, staying separate from mine, so as to not take on their thoughts as my own, which I feel was the root of my anxiety - letting others determine my self worth in some way or another, which more often left a very negative feeling. I didn't use a previous positive experience, but this did still rewire my thinking a great deal. 

Just curious if this is an NLP type method possibly, or something else. I just started learning about NLP so I'm really curious.",UgjITF3obP9zPHgCoAEC,17,129,2016-10-29T02:32:45Z,2017-02-14T22:45:23Z

I have been following Richard Grannon for a while, and his statements are illustrating his opinions rather than research. If we have our own values, insted of opinions, we also have great values from empathy, that also walks hand in hand with right research and responsibility to not point out the behaviorproblems in relation to himself, and he talks also about his own experiences and bad relationships with his exes, that i seem to be boundariebreaking. He are not working strict with secrecy or integrity to his former exes, and be responsible to one be one example of sequrity or dignity in relation to his dysfunctional relationships. Sam Vatkin and his cooperation is pointed to some version of beeing Equal in his state of talking about his relation to Sam. But the problems as i see it, is that they seem to cooperate on Sams terms, and not so much apart. Sam is also known with his diagnostic criteria of NPD and Anti social behavior, and in Sams videos he claims all sorts of high intelligence, that he was nine years old when he went to the University etc, etc. They often talk about themselves, insted of the situation in mental health, that also portraits themselves in a good light, and scapegoating others that they had one relationship with, or other psychologists who dont want to work with Sam. Victimized and braging about their educational backround, are often Times represented in his videos. Not so much of trust in their proffessional area Iam afraid. Richard Grannon do what he can, but there is some lack of adultperspective and integrity, that i find not so good, also because the public needs so much sequrity in their Coaching. ✨🇸🇪",UgyZBVBrtSdnTlaTFel4AaABAg,0,33,2019-02-28T17:57:14Z,2019-04-21T20:44:06Z

I also appreciate his humor and tough love. But, when he starts to get more technical into cptsd and how to heal it, he becomes very confusing and I feel worse. On the overall, he gives me a sense of chaos and inconsistency and I am perplexed at his many relationship failures (which I would never judge if he wasn't presenting himself as a sort of healer of those problems too). I am also struck at his enthusiastic collaboration with Sam Vaknin, a clever ""narcopath"" that shares knowledge about his own disorders but could manipulate him as well.

I was blocked from his channel for asking him if it was a YT glitch that made it look like comments where being deleted. Admittedly, I asked to see how he would respond, to see if he would give an honest response, as he after he deleted his IG account made a video where he talked about witchhunting, and about ‘‘lonely, bored, and bitter people with nothing better to do,’’ after having been questioned about his behaviour on his last post on the account before shutting it down.

He had been on a date with a female follower of his who posted pictures of them together right after he went off SM on his ‘break’, and he had flirted with others over IG comments, but questions about this where quickly deleted and he made it out as if people had a problem with him having been on a date, asking if it was a crime, and said it was to protect the involved people that he deleted the questions, even though no one mentioned them by name or anything else that could identify them. It’s not a crime, and it wasn’t about people being mad on him for having been on a date, but when you are openly talking with a female follower, who is beautiful, young and vulnerable and who seeks your guidance in order to heal from abusive relationships, on her photos for everyone to see, about being naked, wrestling and smearing each other in food, and you then have another beautiful female follower flying in to visit you for a date weekend, how can you expect people not to raise their eyebrows and ask about what is going on. He also defended himself by saying that he didn’t dated clients, but how is it that dating and flirting vulnerable followers/customers who comes to you for guidance and help is any different? I have a hard time seeing the difference, and after what I’ve seen, I feel uneasy about him saying that he “will be moving on to work with young people from the age of 16 - 24”. And him making it out as a witchhunt made by people who are bitter and lonely with nothing better to do, when it really is people raising their concerns about his behaviour which are documented and can be proven...

I share the things I get from Richards videos and so far my Therapist has not had issues with anything I have adopted from Richard. I think what is lost by some professionals is that Richard lived what he discusses and I think the reason he is so popular is that the Psychiatric community as a whole has not been available to everyone and Richard is throwing out a life line.

I think that the training of people to use emotions in their business leads to feelings of invulnerability and the need to be right all the time, which can be dangerous in terms of ethics.  Too many life coaches I have worked with had no tangible answers to anything that was not purely emotional.

And (2) Can I offer a critique Richard Grannon Spartan Life Coach YouTube ...,to19aZiiwRg,"I subscribe to both you and RG’s channels you have both helped me. The difference for me is that you are a licenced professional and RG helps by sharing his experience (I believe he suffered childhood abuse and is a survivor of abuse in romantic relationships). I think both your perspectives are useful. Your criticism that you have to look at evidence if you feel that something is wrong, is problematic. My mind was so fried from gaslighting, I no longer had my critical faculties intact. We cannot necessarily apply the scientific method when we are in the soup, and I’m sure you will agree, that is exactly when you need a professional to help you ascertain what is happening (are you being abused). However it is arrogant to believe that everyone has access to professional help, that’s why YouTube is an absolute lifesaver. I have benefited hugely from listening to multiple youtubers, professionals, coaches etc, eg Meredith Miller (Inner Integration) and Dr Abdul Saad (Vital Mind), Joanna Kujath, Sam Vaknin, Dr Ramani Durvasula, Dr Palmatier (Shrink4Men), Soul GPS to name a few, to really get a grip on the subject, I have a psych degree, so I perhaps have some sort of framework (academic critical, analytic) to order my ‘findings’, which helps. I enjoy the different perspectives, and I appreciate the ‘policing’ you do, according to your scientific principles. All established bodies have a territory to defend, but I will continue to look under all rocks to find my answers. I do agree that coaches selling product online to vulnerable, traumatized individuals should be called out for making wildly inaccurate statements (personality does not have a genetic component!).
