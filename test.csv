At some point it will stablise, but brexit will leave us with a net ...",vfpoWU2jsJc,"Ahead from the Brexit referendum it was suggested, that as many as 17,000 bank jobs would be moving from London to the EU. That though was probably assuming reciprocity.
Now the careful suggestion is as much as 35,000 banking jobs are moving to Europe. That is more than double of what was nominated the ‚Äúworst‚Äù case scenario. 
Looking at the data though, I am sure banks will continue to use the moves and Brexit as a perfect opportunity to reduce their overall staff and cost. In consequence maybe 35,000 jobs may move, but we should expect that as many additional jobs will be cut, leading to a net loss 70,000 jobs or more. That is a reduction of more than 10% employed personnel in London banking sector.  
Nonetheless there is still this lingering hope in the back of the head that all these jobs will only leave temporarily and eventually come back to London. I fear, that a reality check is needed, as if they do, they will be less than before Brexit anyway.
And as much as London was and for sure still is a magnet for successful bankers and those who want to become the rainmakers of the future. But let‚Äôs not forget, history gives some good examples of financial centers that moved to other places that they will not move back for generations to come.

To the current situation I suggest the Reuters article from May 12th 2021 that makes for an interesting reading.

This is is not entirely true and borderline false. 
There are essentially two kinds of financial institutions in the finance. First, the large, massive institutions that have responsibilities to retail street customers. These are the kinds of institutions that are often deemed ""too big to  fail"". They usually have a history going back hundreds of years and employ 10Ks of people. Think Barclays, RBS, Goldman Sachs, etc. The second kind of financial institution are the hedge funds, the small fast moving, high risk, institutions that are composed of a hundred or so talented individuals that focus on high wealth customers with the aim of making as much profit as fast as possible in as short a time as possible.
The thing is, the credit crunch and the sovereign debt crisis required governments to impose tighter regulation on all financial institutions that needed to trade. The reason being was that the larger institutions were seen as behaving like the hedge funds - taking unnecessary risks and exposing themselves, and therefore their customers to large losses. Which is fine if you are a hedge fund, but not so good if you have 100K of retail bank customers and you are responsible for their savings, pensions, mortgages etc. Thus these regulations were imposed to reduce risk and minimise the potential damage to ordinary retail customers. This regulation was seen as a good thing, buy the general public, who had after all, been asked to ""bail out the banks"".

So how did the financial institutions regard this regulation? The larger institutions were in general, in favour. They had been stung badly by the crises, and did not like high risk strategies anyway. But they had been in a race to the bottom of risky practices - forced upon them if they were to simply compete with the smaller high risk hedge-fund institutions.

But the smaller hedge fund style institutions absolutely ""hated"" these regulations. Their business model was ""high-risk-high-return"" and designed to appeal to the ultra wealthy. Being forced to obey the same regulations as the bigger institutions was and is seem as an unfair hindrance.

So how did the large and small institutions regard Brexit? The large institution wanted stability. They did not like the uncertainty and they are far more invested in the overall economy of the UK. Good economy = less uncertainty = less risk = steady business. The economists were and are clear, Brexit is bad for the economy and losing the EU customers would be devastating for them and their 100Ks of customers.

The small hedge fund institutions however, were heavily favour of Brexit. It was high risk and thus an opportunity to make HUGE profits. They WANTED to rock the boat. And their high wealth customers could afford to take the hit if it went sideways. It is no accident that the money men funding the Brexit campaigns have deep associations the the hedge funds, Tory government and the UK media barons.",UgySUpUKlgAztR6qDHt4AaABAg,0,6,2021-06-01T05:00:13Z,2021-06-01T08:48:26Z

Almost all of their business is with the EU, not in the UK. In order to keep trading, they have 2 options, namely: 
1) Set up an office in Luxembourg. This would require a senior member of staff to be present in said office during business hours. Total cost to them - approx ¬£100,000 - which they don't have. They are 'small fry.'
2) Employ a company already in Luxembourg to act as what is known as a Factor. Sadly, were they to do this, they would have to pay a substantial percentage to this other company - which would wipe out my nephew's company's profits.
